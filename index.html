                            <h2>Project Watty</h2>
                            <h4>INFO</h4>
                            <p>This project took place at the department of Informatics, Uppsala Universitet, during autumn 2015</p>
                            <h4>BACKGROUND & TASK</h4>
                            <p>Watty is a company that specializes in household energy management. They have a device that quantifies the electricity consumption in price and CO2 footprint. Watty’s goal is to give customers insight, information and control over their electricity consumption. The idea is that the customer can access this information threw an application. The primary target group for Watty is households who pay for electricity separately. The company is interested in how to use less energy, produce less of a carbon footprint and saving money by using less electricity. The people using Watty are interested in new technology, have an internet connection and access to a smartphone. The Watty app should be easy to use for everybody, including people who is not especially interested and used to new technologies. The Watty application can be used everywhere. Anywhere there is access to smart phones and internet connection. My task was to examine the situation from end-user perspective, and create a design proposal, for their mobile application / energy management product. </p>
                            <h4>ROLE</h4>
                            <p>UX designer, Interaction designer and Visual designer.</p>
                            <h4>APPROACH</h4>
                            <p>This design project relied upon a user centered design approach, wherein any solution presented is based on an understanding of the users, tasks and environment. The design was driven and refined by user-centered evaluation. The process was iterative and addressed the entire user experience. I started with doing some research. I conducted interviews and a minor literature study to understand the user group and area. </p>
                            <p>Findings from research paper: indicated that providing feedback about energy usage can give consumers a better control and promote sustainable energy consumption. Darby, S; The effectiveness of feedback on energy consumption. 2006 found that improved feedback may reduce consumption by up to 20% and Fischer, Corinna; Feedback on household electricity consumption: a tool for saving
                                energy; 2008 researched indicated that , the effective feedback should successfully capture users attention, with a clear and close link between actions and their effects, as well as motivate and appeal to different users. They compared 26 projects lasting up to 20 years and concluded characteristics of good feedback. Fischer, had some thoughts regarding the frequency of feedback, and his study indicated that immediate feedback is the most helpful. In order to stimulate new energy using behavior. His study also indicated that feedback should be long-term as well. Give users new information about there energy consumption continuously. He also stated that the feedback should be about costs and environment as well. Wokje Abrahamse;The effect of tailored information, goal setting, and tailored
                                feedback on household energy use; 2007. Showed how important tailored information were, for motivating the users to change their behavior towards energy consumption.His study showed that households who were given tailored information and tailored feedback lowered their energy consumption with 5.1%, but households without tailored information and feedback increaed their energy consumption with 0.7%, which means that users are likely to change their behavior if they are given personalized/tailored suggestions. His study also indicate that electronic feedback is good because it can react to electricity consumption in real-time and quickly be processed and presented to the users. Abrahamse also state that additional information(like instructions and tips) should be provided to help the users lower their consumption.</p>
                            <p>Another source of interest was Westley Schultz’s study “Magnetic middle”. According to Schultz, the phenomenon “magnetic middle” occurs when users are compared to the average of electricity consumption. If the total consumption is visualized by means of a meter and the average is placed in the center, users with consumption under average tend to increase their consumption, and those who have higher than average are lowering their consumption. The average measures acts like a magnet.</p>

                            <p>Findings from interviews: My interviews was simple semi-structured and indicated primarily that information about environment and costs was the most interesting. The interviewees mentioned their wish to see a division between household activities/appliances, and an appliance breakdown. Many interviewees also mentioned that they wanted to see a comparison between different averages. What all interviewees wanted, was to receive short concise tips on how they could reduce their electricity consumption.I also asked the interviewees about their opinion regarding how they wanted to receive the information. And all of them wanted to obtain information in real time by using an application, website or by letter.</p>

                            <p>These finding created the base understanding of the user and area and after analyzing and summing up the conducted
                                findings I created two personas. Lars, the retired banker interested in saving money and Maja, the landscape architect and  environmentalist.  I then created some requirements based on these personas. I then started the first design iteration, which only was sketching on paper and coming up with ideas. Some of these ideas made it to the second iteration. In this iteration i created a Lofi-prototype, some pictures of it is presented below.</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lofiappli.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>Here you can see the main page, where the user can follow their energy consumption in real time. There is also a visualization of the side menu, and some of the thoughts i had around other functionality in the application. To the right is the view of appliances, or appliance breakdown. There is also a visualization of a tip reading the heating. </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lofifeedback.JPG" alt="">
                            Here you see the first thoughts about how the users would get feedback from the application. When the user for example change something in there household that lower there energy consumption, they get a message and notification from the application. I also mad two different feedback messages based on the personas. One that informs the user about how much money they saved and one about there lowered carbon dioxide emission. This Lofi-prototype were also iterative and tested. The third iteration was about creating a Hifi-prototype to get a better understanding on how the finished application would look. below you see some picture
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/step1.JPG" alt="">
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/step2.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>Here you can see how the Login and sign up interface. I decided that the first screen of the application should contain a tip that would have an easy access so the user would feel comfortable and not overwhelmed at the start of using Watty. I also decided to have two methods for signing in to the application, one with a Watty account and the other with a Facebook account to enable sharing of the results on social media(social and ideological pleasure). When signing up the user enter his or her name, email address, the size of the house in square meters and the number of people living in it. I also added two sliders to determine the user's interest in two main areas the reduction of their carbon footprint and the reduction of the cost of electricity. The two sliders will tailor the information the user will receive according to their selection. There is also a process funnel to give the user an idea of were and how far they are in the registration process</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/myconsumption.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>The first screen that the user sees after signing in is their consumption of electricity and they can toggle between hourly, daily, monthly or year view. The user will also be able to see the current consumption updated every few seconds and get immediate feedback when something concerning their electricity usage is changing in the household. The user can press the menu button in the upper left corner to access other functionality of the application. The upper right corner is reserved for getting notifications about messages that is delivered by Watty.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/appliences.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>Here is the appliance view the user gets an overview of the appliances and home electronics in their household, the user also gets tips on reducing their energy usage when appliances and home electronics use an excessive amount of energy. The user can toggle between bar view and pie-chart view.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Tip.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>Here is the tips view, the user can see tips grouped in different categories on how to lower energy usage based on what appliances and electronics the user has in their residence. In the example at the top the user select a heating category and receives a list of different tips. When the user then selects a tip it shows further information and approximate savings.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/socialmedia.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>This is the Message and social media sharing view, When the user clicks at the messages button in the side menu they get to the first screen on the left. The new messages are marked with a blue dot. When opening the message it says We see change! The user gets a tailored message saying how much they have saved in percent and depending on their preferences in the setup of the application the feedback will be shown either in money or in carbon dioxide emissions. The user is also able to share the message on social media.</p>
                            <p>My design has many advantages. It is easy to learn in the way that it provides the user with visual aids with various types of symbols, both pictographic and ideographic. The graphic code is also helpful in an exploratory way. The design is also consistent in the sense that
                                locating symbols are at the same places wherever you find yourself in the application. I have also thought of aspects that give the user control. For example it is easy to navigate an steer in the application. </p>
                            <p>One thing I am very satisfied with is the flexibility of my design. It provides several ways of	doing things. For example, the user can see tips, by clicking at the small question marks in “Appliances” or see all the tips in the menu choice “Tips”. The app also provides the user
                                with constructive and helpful system messages. The design also leaves room for future functionality or enhancements. The application is safe to use, the user does not have to share progress or information about their electricity consumption if they don't want to, Another advantage of my application is that it gives users both sociological and ideological pleasure. In the way that the user can select the type of information they want to be presented with. Take Maja as an example. She cares a lot about the environment. When she gets feedback about helping the environment by reducing her carbon emissions, she feels ideologically pleased and when she shares this, sociological.</p>
                            <p>There is always room for improvement. Currently Watty is trying to figure out a way to make their users to continue using the app. I thought about this and had it in mind when I designed the application. In order to accomplish this I thought Watty should release new functionalities over time. Just like a game, releasing expansions and other additions to retain their users. A functionality I have devised is “achievements”. It works like a simple scoring system where the user gets points by obtaining achievements. An achievement can for example be about saving money, when the user reaches a specific amount, he or she obtains this achievement, which can be shared. I
                                think that this would motivate users to want to reduce their electricity consumption even more and continue to use the app. </p>

                            <h4>SUMMARY</h4>
                            <p>My task was to examine the situation from end-user perspective, and create a design proposal, for their mobile application / energy management product. I found several things or factors to take into consideration after conducting interviews and reading research papers. Factors like frequent feedback, tailored information, appliance breakdown, the danger with using average-measurements. These factors resulted in the creation of two personas that were used in the design phase. The design phase included paper-and-pen, Lofi, Hifi prototypes.
                                I have choose to work with a design to increase user engagement with the service and profile it as a tool where you can both save money and the environment. This will also enable the users to change their behaviors to a more energy-efficient lifestyle.

                                I learned a lot from this project, I got to explore a new user area by research, I got to created personas and i got to create a lot of prototypes. This project taught me how designing from scratch might look like. I also got an idea of how long it takes to complete interactive prototypes. It was a challenging, fun project that made me use creative and logical thinking. </p>

                            <h2>Acrobat Reader vs PDF Expert (A Usability Evaluation Project)</h2>
                            <h4>INFO</h4>
                            <p>This project took place at the department of ITC, Uppsala University, during autumn 2015</p>
                            <h4>BACKGROUND </h4>
                            <p>Usability testing is a technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate a product by testing it on users. This can be seen as an irreplaceable usability practice, since it gives direct input on how real users use the system. This is in contrast with usability inspection methods where experts use different methods to evaluate a user interface without involving users. Usability testing focuses on measuring a human-made product's capacity to meet its intended purpose. This project is about a Usability Evaluation of the two most popular iOS PDF Applications. There are several good eBook Reader Apps available on the iOS App Store® (Apple trademark). According to the amount of downloads Acrobat Reader® (Adobe  trademark) is the most popular one, but is it also the most efficient one?</p>
                            <h4>TASK</h4>
                            <p>My task was to conduct a usability test. What to be tested was up to me and I chose to test two PDF applications by comparing them. The usability test included user testing and video/statistical analyzes. </p>
                            <h4>ROLE</h4>
                            <p>Usability tester</p>
                            <h4>APPROACH</h4>
                            <p>This was more of an open project where I chose what to test. I had previously been using the PDF reader Acrobat Reader for literature and wanted to test whether there were any better PDF readers available. I therefor chose to test the efficiency of Acrobat Reader by comparing it with another PDF reader. The most obvious rival to Acrobat Reader was PDF Expert® (READDLE INC. trademark). This software had the highest ratings and the most positive feedback comments on iOS App store. This application also cost 10 euro, which made the comparison even more interesting.  The project started with defining the test plan (this is later described in the text). The null hypothesis for this test was: </p>
                            <p>h0: PDF Expert is equally efficient as Acrobat Reader<br />
                                h1: PDF Expert is more efficient than Acrobat Reader</p>
                            <p>I started with performing a pilot-test on one of my classmates. This pilot-test created the basic understanding and structure for the usability test. The usability lab used for this Usability Test Project (UTP) was provided by the Uppsala University HCI Department. The lab consists of an observation room and a test room. </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/TestRoom.jpg" alt="">
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/CommandCenter.jpeg" alt="">
                            <p>The observation room is equipped with a computer and detached from the test room by a one-way mirror. All needed observational softwares for conducting a usability test were preinstalled on the computer. The Observation XT software was later used for analyzing the recorded data.</p>
                            <p>This Usability test project (UTP) compared the efficiency of the eBook Readers “Adobe Acrobat Reader” and “PDF Expert” while working with course literature on an iPad® (Apple trademark). Both systems have different user interfaces. The goals of the usability test were to find which interface was more efficient and has the most subjective preference (satisfaction). The efficiency was tested by completing different tasks in the usability lab. The user satisfaction will be identified through surveys. The device used in test was an iPad 2 mini.</p>
                            <p>Every session began with me giving the participant an introduction by providing background information about the project and how the data gathered is going to be used. At the end of the introduction phase the participant was asked to sign the participation consent form (for ethical reasons). I then explained the test environment and how the test was going to be executed. The test was split into two parts. In one part we tested Adobe Acrobat Reader and in the other part the PDF Expert. Each part ended with a questionnaire about the tested applications. Which part the participants started with varied to eliminate bias. Each application had a similar task list, Task 1: Navigate to a specific chapter, Task 2: find a specific headline, Task 3: highlight the headline, Task 4:  add a specific note, Task 5: undo both the highlight and note. Each task was measured separately by measuring time to execute each task. </p>
                            <p>These are the methods I used to collect data: Observation and video recording on the tablet screen and on the participant's hand movement and a standardized usability questionnaire given after testing each system. It is worth mentioning that a statistical hypothesis test is always done with the help of a random sample. The students at Uppsala University constitute the frame population in this study. Nevertheless, there was a long and intensive selection process because of the prerequisite that the participant had to have no experience using any PDF application on an iPad. This was to eliminate bias. Further, I made sure that there was an equal ratio between male and female participants. The age range was 18-35 years. At the end, fourteen students took part in this usability test. I used Excel® to create the data-set. The data-set was filled with data from each participant. Each participant was timed ten times, as there were five tasks with Acrobat Reader and five tasks with PDF Expert. These tasks were measured in seconds, and by comparing tasks or adding them together made the data useful. I also analyzed the data with the following statistics tests: Q-Q Plots, T-Test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/wilcoxonSignedRanksTest.png" alt="">
                            <p>The results indicated that the standard deviation was high but also that it was higher in all tasks for Acrobat Reader. This means that the results from using Acrobat Reader were more diverse. I believe this is due to Acrobat Readers slightly inferior optimized response for touch gestures. PDF Expert has a bit stronger touch functionality. But this is something that could be further investigated using software benchmark tests. The results of the two-sample t-test and wilcoxon-test showed that there were a significant difference between Acrobat Reader and PDF Expert. I therefore have empirical evidence to reject the null hypothesis with a significance level of 5 %. In other words, PDF Expert is more efficient than Acrobat Reader. The user experience questionnaire showed no substantial difference between the participants approval. After analyzing the test results, I gained an insight into the software’s pros and cons from an efficiency perspective. I studied these differences and discovered a number of usability violations. These discoveries form the key findings in this evaluation and are presented below with illustrating pictures.</p>

                            <p><b>Show the right page number</b><br />
                                One of the major problems in Adobe Acrobat Reader that most participants struggled with was the discrepancy in the page numbers. As shown in the picture below Adobe Acrobat is showing “Page 151” on the slider but on the document it says “Page 133”. This is not the case in PDF Expert as shown in figure 4. This is a small fix that can be made by Adobe and would avoid confusion and substantially increase the retrievability of the pages.
                                <b>Usability violation:</b> Visibility</p>

                            <p><b>Placement of chapter button in Adobe vs PDF Expert</b><br />
                                Another problem found was the struggle in finding a chapter in Adobe Acrobat Reader. The button for this is positioned at the bottom-right corner of the interface which led to a longer finding time. Many of the participants rather went for a workaround than finding the “Chapter Shortcut” button. In Comparison to PDF Expert the “Chapter Shortcut” button is placed in top-right corner which gives the function according to the test results a better visibility.

                            <p><b>Searching in Adobe Acrobat Reader</b><br />
                                Another problem some of the participants faced with Acrobat Reader was while using the search function. When the search function is active then no other actions can be made. The user needs to exit search mode by explicitly clicking the “Cancel” button before being able to do anything else. This led to confusion and frustration, and help from me was needed.

                            <p><b>Undo in Adobe Acrobat Reader</b><br />
                                Undoing comments and highlights was something that was not clear in Adobe Acrobat Reader. The “Undo” button is placed on a position that is far away from the area where the last interaction was made. The button is also made of text and doesn’t have any icon. The common icon for undo is not shown at all. This problem could be solved by either placing the button on the pop-up button list, for example next to the “Clear” button, or changing the button from text to icon. As a side note, the “Clear” functionality just removes the highlighted part and “Undo” functionality is undoing the last action.

                            <p><b>Predetermined Text for Notes in Adobe Acrobat Reader</b><br />
                                One small feature that Acrobat Reader uses, is that it has a predefined text (“viktigt”, meaning "important") when you add a note. This led to confusion for the majority of the test participants because the predetermined text is not a placeholder and it cannot be removed. The removal of the predetermined text or having at least to convert it to a placeholder would rapidly increase the usability of this function.

                            <h4>SUMMARY</h4>
                            <p>The objectives of this usability test project were to measure and compare efficiency and the subjective experience and satisfaction between two PDF applications when using an iPad. Results showed that PDF Expert is more efficient than Acrobat Reader. The Collected data and statistical tests created a map of problem areas. The identified problem areas were analyzed which produced a list of usability violations concerning constraints, feedback and visibility. These problems were addressed with alternative solutions

                                This project was a unique opportunity to explore a new way of evaluating systems. To use my statistical knowledge in practice like this was a new experience.  The hands-on experience of using a proper usability testing lab and being able to statistically analyze the usability of a system, will surely be a valuable asset for the future. I also learned the importance of doing a pilot test. For example many participants did not know if they have completed a task or not, which were addressed in the real test.

                            <h2>Phase 0 (A User-centered Design Project)</h2>
                            <h4>INFO</h4>
                            <p>This project took place at the department of ITC, Uppsala University, during spring 2016.</p>
                            <h4>BACKGROUND </h4>
                            <p>The objective of this project was to conduct a Phase 0, which includes user involvement, work-analyses and an overall UX design to to address the problems/workarounds found. I worked with the organization Center for Health Care (CVO) in this project. The Center for Health Care (CVO) is running LSS housings, daily activities and housing for unaccompanied refugees. The staff speaks English and Swedish and are educated in care programs, ART , neuropsychology and in mental health care.  The system this LSS housing is currently using is called "MedvindArbetstid" and is a product that can handle operations with varying requirements for scheduling and manpower planning. The product supports all currently existing working models such as normal schedule, flexible hours, annual working hours, time banking, desired work hours and scoring models. CVO use this system for scheduling of personnel and time tracking. The usability and user experience of this software system is crucial as employees within the organization use the software on a daily basis.</p>
                            <h4>TASK</h4>
                            <p>The software CVO use for scheduling and time tracking is called "MedvindArbetstid" and I was asked to examine the perceived problems with this software. I worked closely with one of the users, a Unit Manager who expressed that the software was "ineffective". My task was to understand the users work domain, describe it and create a vision of the future in terms of a prototype.</p>
                            <h4>ROLE</h4>
                            <p>UX designer, Interaction designer and Visual designer.</p>
                            <h4>APPROACH</h4>
                            <p> This design project relied upon a user centered design approach, wherein any solution presented is based on an understanding of the users, tasks and environment. The users have been involved throughout the design development. The design was driven and refined by user-centered evaluation. The process was iterative and addressed the entire user experience. </p>
                            <p>I started with the contextual inquiry. The contextual inquiry contains work analyses of the Unit Manager at CVO. Below I present some of the work models that describe this work. The work analyses are based on two sessions with the user; both of these sessions were contextual interviews, i.e. a kind of field study with the user doing real work. I chose to work with a master/apprentice idea where the user was the master and the author acted apprentice. The user was in charge and I kept a low profile. I didn't have a formal set of interview questions, more of a laid back attitude with a focus on observing and learning. I tried to see the domain as the user did.   </p>
                            <p>The contextual interviews resulted in large quantities of unwieldy data, and I needed to structure and interpret it. I conducted a type of affinity diagram where certain meanings were assigned to the observation and reached an understanding of objects, tasks, specific data and relations. I then created a set of work models to present the essential aspects of the work-analyses in a graphical and systematic way. Examples of these work models are presented and described below.  </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/flow.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>Flow models focus on how the users communicate and coordinate to get the work done. This flow model is generated from the perspective of the Unit Manager. The flow model describes the relation between the software "Medvind" and the Users. The relation between the elements can either have a one way or two way relation. The Unit Manager is of special interest for this project due that the observation is based on this role.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/sequence.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>The sequence model describes the steps that the user have to go through to fulfill his tasks. This model defines the breakdowns and intent behind the actions taken. The sequence model shows how the unit manager operates with the task of filling in the monthly report. Because of the systems current structure, the unit is required to do workarounds, which creates breakdowns in the work sequence. In the sequence of fetching and calculating the required data for the monthly report, three breakdowns occur. These breakdowns are described more in detail in another model.</p>
                            <p>My work models created the base for the second session with the user. The second sessions were a follow-up with the goal of validating my view of this work but also to discuss questions that still needed to be answered. The user pointed out that one of the primary problems that he experienced was related to "the monthly report". This problem and breakdown is presented in the work models. The problem is that the software has no functionality that supports the user with this report. The data needed in the report is available in the software but the user is forced (in a tedious way) to "click around" to find the data needed and then manually calculate it. The user felt that the software is slow and complex. With this in mind I started to discuss the anatomy of the software system. The monthly report is a business object and should have been taken into consideration during the conceptual mapping of the software. This omission is the reason why the problem exists, because if the report would have been considered, it would have been represented among the interface concepts and visual design. I should mention that MedvindArbetstid is used by several companies and that Medvind (the company) tailor make their software to the customers needs. I think that the software is not sufficiently tailored for the user. In summary, the work analyses indicated that the Unit Manager was using additional devices and had developed strategies/workarounds to complete daily work. The user highlighted a number of problems (one of them being "the monthly report") with the software.</p>
                            <p>The contextual inquiry was followed by a Design phase that included prototyping (Lo-fi and Hi-fi) and usability testing). Based on the models and understanding of the users breakdowns in its current state, a Lo-fi prototype was created with the focus of practice design. This first prototype is a low detailed representation of the current system UI with additions to solve the problems found. Since the existing system already manages the data used for the monthly report it felt reasonable for me to build the solution within the existing software. In addition, the basic functionality needed for my solution is already existing in the software today. My solution includes calculations for some of the already existing values and some new data structures. My idea is to create a new tab which displays the values needed for the report. More details can be found in the picture below. I also created a Lo-fi representation of the monthly report showing what values the unit manager has to handle each month.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lofiReport.JPG" alt="">
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lofimonthlyReport.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>This Lo-fi created the basis for the third session that was a walkthrough/formative study. In other words my focus was on discussing my practice design proposal. The purpose of this session was to find potential usability problems to evaluate whether the overall structure, navigation and workflow worked. The results of this session showed that the Unit Manager liked the proposal overall, but had some good input and additions of what information should be available. For example, I had an area that was undefined in the Lo-fi prototype and the user suggested that this area could be for statistical graphs showing comparison between monthly results and other time periods. There also was a request for combining months, i.e. add them together, for example in quarters since the users had quarterly reports to handle as well. </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/hifiUI.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>The design phase continued with addressing the feedback from session three and developing a more detailed prototype. This prototype also had interactions on the most important functions. This created the basis for the fourth and last session with the user. This session was a summary study. The purpose with this session was to find potential usability problems with the detailed structure (such as wording, placement of dialogue elements, and graphical expressions). The results of this session indicated that the summary diagram in the down right corner was only useful when selecting a specific value in the table. This graphical expression was therefore removed from this view and placed in an alternative view of summary of one specific value (this is presented in one of the pictures of the prototype below). Another finding was the lack of affordance. Some of the buttons were changed by adding shadows which made them look more "clickable". </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/specificValue.JPG" alt="">
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/revisedHifi.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>These four sessions and iterations of the prototype were then compiled in a report for the user (the unit manager). This report created the so called Phase 0 for the development. This report was later used by the unit manager as foundation and problem description for the software developers of Medvidarbetstid.  </p>
                            <h4>SUMMARY</h4>
                            <p>The objective of this project was to conduct a Phase 0, which includes user involvement, work analyses and an overall UX design to address the problems/workarounds found. The work analyses indicated that the Unit Manager is using additional devices and have developed strategies/workarounds to complete daily work. The solution is based on the basic functionality of the existing software. The solution addresses the problems of the user by calculating and summarizing data in a self-explanatory and tailor-made way. This project taught me a lot. I learned alternative ways to understand the user switch and carry out a contextual inquiry. I also got practical experience of working iteratively with users.</p>
