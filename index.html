                            <p>This project took place at the department of Informatics, Uppsala Universitet, during autumn 2015</p>
                            <h4>BACKGROUND AND TASK</h4>
                            <p>Watty is a company that specializes in household energy management. They have a device that quantifies the electricity consumption in price and CO2 footprint. Watty’s goal is to give customers insight, information and control over their electricity consumption. The idea is that the customer can access this information threw an application. My task was to examine the situation from end-user perspective, and create a design proposal, for their mobile application / energy management product. </p>

                            <h4>INFO</h4>
                            <p>This project took place at the department of ITC, Uppsala University, during spring 2016.</p>
                            <h4>BACKGROUND </h4>
                            <p>The objective of this project was to conduct a Phase 0, which includes user involvement, work-analyses and an overall UX design to to address the problems/workarounds found. I worked with the organization Center for Health Care (CVO) in this project. The Center for Health Care (CVO) is running LSS housings, daily activities and housing for unaccompanied refugees. The staff speaks English and Swedish and are educated in care programs, ART , neuropsychology and in mental health care.  The system this LSS housing is currently using is called "MedvindArbetstid" and is a product that can handle operations with varying requirements for scheduling and manpower planning. The product supports all currently existing working models such as normal schedule, flexible hours, annual working hours, time banking, desired work hours and scoring models. CVO use this system for scheduling of personnel and time tracking. The usability and user experience of this software system is crucial as employees within the organization use the software on a daily basis.</p>
                            <h4>TASK</h4>
                            <p>The software CVO use for scheduling and time tracking is called "MedvindArbetstid" and I was asked to examine the perceived problems with this software. I worked closely with one of the users, a Unit Manager who expressed that the software was "ineffective". My task was to understand the users work domain, describe it and create a vision of the future in terms of a prototype.</p>
                            <h4>ROLE</h4>
                            <p>UX designer, Interaction designer and Visual designer.</p>
                            <h4>APPROACH</h4>
                            <p> This design project relied upon a user centered design approach, wherein any solution presented is based on an understanding of the users, tasks and environment. The users have been involved throughout the design development. The design was driven and refined by user-centered evaluation. The process was iterative and addressed the entire user experience. </p>
                            <p>I started with the contextual inquiry. The contextual inquiry contains work analyses of the Unit Manager at CVO. Below I present some of the work models that describe this work. The work analyses are based on two sessions with the user; both of these sessions were contextual interviews, i.e. a kind of field study with the user doing real work. I chose to work with a master/apprentice idea where the user was the master and the author acted apprentice. The user was in charge and I kept a low profile. I didn't have a formal set of interview questions, more of a laid back attitude with a focus on observing and learning. I tried to see the domain as the user did.   </p>
                            <p>The contextual interviews resulted in large quantities of unwieldy data, and I needed to structure and interpret it. I conducted a type of affinity diagram where certain meanings were assigned to the observation and reached an understanding of objects, tasks, specific data and relations. I then created a set of work models to present the essential aspects of the work-analyses in a graphical and systematic way. Examples of these work models are presented and described below.  </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/flow.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>Flow models focus on how the users communicate and coordinate to get the work done. This flow model is generated from the perspective of the Unit Manager. The flow model describes the relation between the software "Medvind" and the Users. The relation between the elements can either have a one way or two way relation. The Unit Manager is of special interest for this project due that the observation is based on this role.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/sequence.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>The sequence model describes the steps that the user have to go through to fulfill his tasks. This model defines the breakdowns and intent behind the actions taken. The sequence model shows how the unit manager operates with the task of filling in the monthly report. Because of the systems current structure, the unit is required to do workarounds, which creates breakdowns in the work sequence. In the sequence of fetching and calculating the required data for the monthly report, three breakdowns occur. These breakdowns are described more in detail in another model.</p>
                            <p>My work models created the base for the second session with the user. The second sessions were a follow-up with the goal of validating my view of this work but also to discuss questions that still needed to be answered. The user pointed out that one of the primary problems that he experienced was related to "the monthly report". This problem and breakdown is presented in the work models. The problem is that the software has no functionality that supports the user with this report. The data needed in the report is available in the software but the user is forced (in a tedious way) to "click around" to find the data needed and then manually calculate it. The user felt that the software is slow and complex. With this in mind I started to discuss the anatomy of the software system. The monthly report is a business object and should have been taken into consideration during the conceptual mapping of the software. This omission is the reason why the problem exists, because if the report would have been considered, it would have been represented among the interface concepts and visual design. I should mention that MedvindArbetstid is used by several companies and that Medvind (the company) tailor make their software to the customers needs. I think that the software is not sufficiently tailored for the user. In summary, the work analyses indicated that the Unit Manager was using additional devices and had developed strategies/workarounds to complete daily work. The user highlighted a number of problems (one of them being "the monthly report") with the software.</p>
                            <p>The contextual inquiry was followed by a Design phase that included prototyping (Lo-fi and Hi-fi) and usability testing). Based on the models and understanding of the users breakdowns in its current state, a Lo-fi prototype was created with the focus of practice design. This first prototype is a low detailed representation of the current system UI with additions to solve the problems found. Since the existing system already manages the data used for the monthly report it felt reasonable for me to build the solution within the existing software. In addition, the basic functionality needed for my solution is already existing in the software today. My solution includes calculations for some of the already existing values and some new data structures. My idea is to create a new tab which displays the values needed for the report. More details can be found in the picture below. I also created a Lo-fi representation of the monthly report showing what values the unit manager has to handle each month.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lofiReport.JPG" alt="">
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lofimonthlyReport.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>This Lo-fi created the basis for the third session that was a walkthrough/formative study. In other words my focus was on discussing my practice design proposal. The purpose of this session was to find potential usability problems to evaluate whether the overall structure, navigation and workflow worked. The results of this session showed that the Unit Manager liked the proposal overall, but had some good input and additions of what information should be available. For example, I had an area that was undefined in the Lo-fi prototype and the user suggested that this area could be for statistical graphs showing comparison between monthly results and other time periods. There also was a request for combining months, i.e. add them together, for example in quarters since the users had quarterly reports to handle as well. </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/hifiUI.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>The design phase continued with addressing the feedback from session three and developing a more detailed prototype. This prototype also had interactions on the most important functions. This created the basis for the fourth and last session with the user. This session was a summary study. The purpose with this session was to find potential usability problems with the detailed structure (such as wording, placement of dialogue elements, and graphical expressions). The results of this session indicated that the summary diagram in the down right corner was only useful when selecting a specific value in the table. This graphical expression was therefore removed from this view and placed in an alternative view of summary of one specific value (this is presented in one of the pictures of the prototype below). Another finding was the lack of affordance. Some of the buttons were changed by adding shadows which made them look more "clickable". </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/specificValue.JPG" alt="">
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/revisedHifi.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>These four sessions and iterations of the prototype were then compiled in a report for the user (the unit manager). This report created the so called Phase 0 for the development. This report was later used by the unit manager as foundation and problem description for the software developers of Medvidarbetstid.  </p>
                            <h4>SUMMARY</h4>
                            <p>The objective of this project was to conduct a Phase 0, which includes user involvement, work analyses and an overall UX design to address the problems/workarounds found. The work analyses indicated that the Unit Manager is using additional devices and have developed strategies/workarounds to complete daily work. The solution is based on the basic functionality of the existing software. The solution addresses the problems of the user by calculating and summarizing data in a self-explanatory and tailor-made way. This project taught me a lot. I learned alternative ways to understand the user switch and carry out a contextual inquiry. I also got practical experience of working iteratively with users.</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/flow.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>Flow models focus on how the users communicate and coordinate to get the work done. This flow model is generated from the perspective of the Unit Manager. The flow model describes the relation between the software "Medvind" and the Users. The relation between the elements can either have a one way or two way relation. The Unit Manager is of special interest for this project due that the observation is based on this role.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/sequence.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>The sequence model describes the steps that the user have to go through to fulfill his tasks. This model defines the breakdowns and intent behind the actions taken. The sequence model shows how the unit manager operates with the task of filling in the monthly report. Because of the systems current structure, the unit is required to do workarounds, which creates breakdowns in the work sequence. In the sequence of fetching and calculating the required data for the monthly report, three breakdowns occur. These breakdowns are described more in detail in another model.</p>
                            <p>My work models created the base for the second session with the user. The second sessions were a follow-up with the goal of validating my view of this work but also to discuss questions that still needed to be answered. The user pointed out that one of the primary problems that he experienced was related to "the monthly report". This problem and breakdown is presented in the work models. The problem is that the software has no functionality that supports the user with this report. The data needed in the report is available in the software but the user is forced (in a tedious way) to "click around" to find the data needed and then manually calculate it. The user felt that the software is slow and complex. With this in mind I started to discuss the anatomy of the software system. The monthly report is a business object and should have been taken into consideration during the conceptual mapping of the software. This omission is the reason why the problem exists, because if the report would have been considered, it would have been represented among the interface concepts and visual design. I should mention that MedvindArbetstid is used by several companies and that Medvind (the company) tailor make their software to the customers needs. I think that the software is not sufficiently tailored for the user. In summary, the work analyses indicated that the Unit Manager was using additional devices and had developed strategies/workarounds to complete daily work. The user highlighted a number of problems (one of them being "the monthly report") with the software.</p>
                            <p>The contextual inquiry was followed by a Design phase that included prototyping (Lo-fi and Hi-fi) and usability testing). Based on the models and understanding of the users breakdowns in its current state, a Lo-fi prototype was created with the focus of practice design. This first prototype is a low detailed representation of the current system UI with additions to solve the problems found. Since the existing system already manages the data used for the monthly report it felt reasonable for me to build the solution within the existing software. In addition, the basic functionality needed for my solution is already existing in the software today. My solution includes calculations for some of the already existing values and some new data structures. My idea is to create a new tab which displays the values needed for the report. More details can be found in the picture below. I also created a Lo-fi representation of the monthly report showing what values the unit manager has to handle each month.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lofiReport.JPG" alt="">
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lofimonthlyReport.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>This Lo-fi created the basis for the third session that was a walkthrough/formative study. In other words my focus was on discussing my practice design proposal. The purpose of this session was to find potential usability problems to evaluate whether the overall structure, navigation and workflow worked. The results of this session showed that the Unit Manager liked the proposal overall, but had some good input and additions of what information should be available. For example, I had an area that was undefined in the Lo-fi prototype and the user suggested that this area could be for statistical graphs showing comparison between monthly results and other time periods. There also was a request for combining months, i.e. add them together, for example in quarters since the users had quarterly reports to handle as well. </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/hifiUI.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>The design phase continued with addressing the feedback from session three and developing a more detailed prototype. This prototype also had interactions on the most important functions. This created the basis for the fourth and last session with the user. This session was a summary study. The purpose with this session was to find potential usability problems with the detailed structure (such as wording, placement of dialogue elements, and graphical expressions). The results of this session indicated that the summary diagram in the down right corner was only useful when selecting a specific value in the table. This graphical expression was therefore removed from this view and placed in an alternative view of summary of one specific value (this is presented in one of the pictures of the prototype below). Another finding was the lack of affordance. Some of the buttons were changed by adding shadows which made them look more "clickable". </p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/revisedHifi.JPG" alt="">
                            <p>These four sessions and iterations of the prototype were then compiled in a report for the user (the unit manager). This report created the so called Phase 0 for the development. This report was later used by the unit manager as foundation and problem description for the software developers of Medvidarbetstid.  </p>
                            <h4>SUMMARY</h4>
                            <p>The objective of this project was to conduct a Phase 0, which includes user involvement, work analyses and an overall UX design to address the problems/workarounds found. The work analyses indicated that the Unit Manager is using additional devices and have developed strategies/workarounds to complete daily work. The solution is based on the basic functionality of the existing software. The solution addresses the problems of the user by calculating and summarizing data in a self-explanatory and tailor-made way. This project taught me a lot. I learned alternative ways to understand the user switch and carry out a contextual inquiry. I also got practical experience of working iteratively with users.</p>
